    <h2>Recipe of Puff Pastry</h2>
    <p>
        These cinnamon puff pastry twists are a handheld, flaky, sweet treat that is 
        kid-friendly, adult approved, and made with few ingredients and minimal effort.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 (17.3 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets</li>
        <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Thaw puff pastry sheet according to package directions, keeping it very cold, 
            and store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unfold the cold puff pastry sheet and place on a lightly-floured surface. 
            Use a rolling pin to gently roll out the creases into a 12-inch wide rectangle, about 1/8-inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a pastry brush to brush melted (room temperature) butter evenly over pastry sheet (if butter is too hot, it will soften pastry). 
            Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and lightly press down, being sure that it has been absorbed into the buttered surface. 
            The butter moistens the sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut pastry sheet from top to bottom into 12 1-inch-wide strips. 
            Chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. Pastry needs to be cold to twist the strips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Twist each strip 5 or 6 times with the cinnamon layer facing inward and the plain pastry on the outside; work quickly so that pastry stays cold. 
            Chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. Chilling is importantâ€”it will keep the twists from spreading and unraveling while baking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and a light golden brown,  14 to 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
        </li>
    </ol>
